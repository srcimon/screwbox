# Getting started

Learn how to get started with the ScrewBox game engine.

:::info

To learn how to create your own game with ScrewBox it's highly recommended to learn about the fundamentals first:

- **[Set up your first project](set-up-your-first-project/index.md)** Create your first executable application using ScrewBox.
- **[Entity System (ECS)](ecs.md)** Learn about the ECS, the very core of every ScrewBox game.
- **[Common data types](../reference/common-data-types.md)** Learn about common types used within the game engine.

## Documentation

To learn more about a specific topic just pick the corresponding topic from the documentation here.
The documentation will grow in time.
There is also a [JavaDoc Documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/dev.screwbox/screwbox-core) available.
But in my personal experience these ones never really helped me to understand anything better.
So don't hesitate and [create an issue](https://github.com/srcimon/screwbox/issues) when you miss something or you simply
have a specific question.
You can also [contact me](/impressum) if you want.

## Sample applications
