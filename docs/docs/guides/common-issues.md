## Bad performance

This might be one of the most common issues that you might encounter.
To debug performance it might be a good idea to enable fps logging by adding the `LogFpsSystem` to your `Environment`.
There can be a lot of reasons for bad performance:

- **Usage of suboptimal rendering API**
  The rendering API might not be detected correctly for your software / hardware setting.
  To fix this, try to set the rendering API explicitly in
  [this guide](../fundamentals/set-up-your-first-project/index.md#rendering-api).

- **Constant adding and removing of entities**
  Adding and removing entities and / or components can reduce performance of the entity component system dramatically
  by invalidating caches.
  Try to avoid adding and removing entities whenever you can.

- **Preparing shaders during run time**
  Rendering of shaders can be very slow.
  Good news is, that shaders use caches to reduce load on the system.
  To make best use of the shader caches, reuse same sprite whenever you can and prepare shaders on scene load.
  Learn more in [this guide](../core-modules/graphics/index.md#shaders).

- **Rendering many half transparent sprites**
  Rendering sprites comes at a cost.
  Rendering transparent sprites has a much higher impact on performance.
  Try to reduce count of drawing tasks to improve rendering performance.

## Error messages in console

Some users might experience similar error messages like the ones below.
Simply ignore these.
Sadly these cannot be avoided on MacOs.
