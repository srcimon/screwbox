Yesterday I reworked the build process to move Maven source to the updated Sonartype Central Repository.
I used the opportunity to update the Maven coordinates to the new domain.
ScrewBox can now be found at the updated coordinates: `dev.screwbox:screwbox-core`.
The update comes with updated packages for all classes and some improvements for the build process.
For further info see [full changelog](https://github.com/srcimon/screwbox/releases/tag/3.0.0).
