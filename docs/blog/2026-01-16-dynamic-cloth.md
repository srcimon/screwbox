Hello there,

the first update of 2026 adds dynamic cloth soft bodies.
Cloth soft bodies support a new mesh shader rendering algorithm to create some 3D like optics.
Cloth rendering also supports (animated) textures.
I've uploaded a short demo for the new feature on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/shorts/O_hHkgLcF_4?feature=share).

As the  creation of soft bodies gets more and more complex, the new `SoftPhysicsSupport` is here to help you.
The class can create all kinds of soft bodies with a single line of code.
Also there is some support to make customizing easier.
The [soft physics guide](/docs/guides/soft-physics) is a good place to start if you want to learn more.
